# final-project

For my final project I want to expand the still life assigment. I want to animate each planet and my model to do a bunch of tricks. 
I made a canva presentation to show some of the animations i want to do.

Some of the challenges i expect to face with this project, will definely be animating the planets, and figuring out the right rhythm for my piece. 
I also think it managing the timeline will be challenging as well. 

Update: 
I am pivoting away from the initial concept of my final project, 
I created an array of the planet meshes, and unfortunately, every time i try to animate the planets using GSAP i get a series of errors in the console.

I also think it managing the timeline will be challenging as well. Another challenge would be calculating the sin and cosin values when doing circular aniimations.
