# final-project

For my final project I want to expand the still life assigment. I want to animate each planet and my model to do a bunch of tricks. 
I made a canva presentation to show some of the animations i want to do.

Some of the challenges i expect to face with this project, will definely be animating the planets, and figuring out the right rhythm for my piece. 
I also think it managing the timeline will be challenging as well. Another challenge would be calculating the sin and cosin values when doing circular aniimations.
